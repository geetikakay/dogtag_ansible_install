About:
-----

This ansible playbook is written to setup all the subsystems(CA,KRA,OCSP,TKS and TPS).
These playbooks can setup the environment based on the topology specified in the runtime.

-------------
Requirements:
-------------

1. Ansible 2.0+ is needed for running these playbooks.
2. It can be downloaded from below mentioned ways:
	 > http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/intro_installation.html
	 > easy_install pip
	 > git clone git://github.com/ansible/ansible.git --recursive
	 > epel

EPEL installation can be easily done from your yum by putting it in the repo directory.

[epel]
name=Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux 7 - $basearch
#baseurl=http://download.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/7/$basearch
mirrorlist=https://mirrors.fedoraproject.org/metalink?repo=epel-7&arch=$basearch
failovermethod=priority
enabled=1
gpgcheck=0
gpgkey=file:///etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-EPEL-7

3. Make sure to check ansible version after installation.This can be quickly done using
ansible --version

	
------
Usage:
------
ansible-playbook -i /tmp/test/pki-tests/ci/ansible/host pki.yml --extra-vars "topology=topology-02" -v

InCase, you are required to run any other topology let us say "topology-01" for shared instance, replace topology-02 with topology-01.


Topology_01:
-----------

All the subsystems shared common tomcat instance  and default configuration attributes for installation.
Default values can be refered from "/etc/pki/default.cfg".


Topology_02:
-----------

LDAP is shared by all subsystems.

About Subsystem Installation:

1. CA ::

Ports Used:

https_port = 20443
http_port = 20080
ajp_port = 20009
tomcat_server_port = 20005

Security Domain:

security_domain_name = topo2_Foobarmaster.org

2. KRA ::

https_port = 21443
http_port = 21080
ajp_port = 21009
tomcat_server_port = 21005

4. TKS ::

https_port = 23443
http_port = 23080
ajp_port = 23009
tomcat_server_port = 23005

5. TPS ::

https_port = 25443
http_port = 25080
ajp_port = 25009
tomcat_server_port = 25005


6. LDAP ::

ServerIdentifier = topology-02_testingmaster
ds_password = Secret123
ds_ldap_port = 3389
client_database_password = Secret123

Topology_03
-----------

This topology installs CA,KRA,OCSP,TKS and TPS.

Topology_04
-----------

This topology installs CA,KRA,TKS and TPS.It doesn't install OCSP.

Topology_05
-----------

This topology install all subsystems and all point to their individual Ldaps.

Topology_ecc
------------

This topology installs ecc installation for CA,KRA and OCSP.

Executing role user creation tests:
-----------------------------
Role user creation has been separated from conftest.py now.
Role user creation is now in a separate test located in the "test_setup" directory at "cli" directory level.

Once you have setup subsystems using ansible, you can now proceed with role user creation.

In order to execute it run the following command from the test_setup directory:
py.test --multihost-config=mhc.yaml test_setup/test_create_role_users.py -vs 

Depending on the topology  installed, roles users will be created accordingly.
For example if we have installed topology 2 through ansible. The, role users
for discrete instances of CA, KRA, OCSP, TKS and TPS will be created.
